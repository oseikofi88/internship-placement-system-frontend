#############INTERNSHIP PLACEMENT SYSTEM (FRONTEND) ##################


  This is a system that I designed and implemented for the faculty of my university in 2017 when I was a student.
  This was used to place students in various organizations based on criteria such as location of student, course of study ,number of slots required by company, company location, etc.

  Angular 4 was used with Google Maps API for geocoding, directions, places(autocomplete) and geolocation used.

  The application is meant for 3 users
  1. Students
  2. Companies
  3. Cordinators
  
  Students could perform the following functions
  1. Register to be placed in a company
  2. Check placement status
  3. Download internship letters
  4. Get location to company placed for  internship
  5. File a complain for issues
  6. Reject placement in favour of a place found by the student himself/herself
  7. Download appraisal forms to be filled by supervisors

  Company could perform the following functions
  1. Register to request for students
  2. Check placement status
  3. See students who have been placed in a company and their details
  4. Confirm when students started and ended internship

  Cordinators could perform the following functions
  1. Get 10 different reports on students placement and company placement
  2. Receive complain query from students and resolve them
  3. Manually place and reject students in companies
  4. Register and place order for students on companies behalf
  5. Replace cordinator
     

  
  

  It has been opened source now because due to changing requirement, a new one has been implemented to be used by the faculty, hence the faculty does not rely on this.
  
  
  This project has not been maintained in 7 years  as a result of me leaving the organization hence a lot of things may change in their implementation for the angular framework.
