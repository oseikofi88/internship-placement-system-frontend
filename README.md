#############INTERNSHIP PLACEMENT SYSTEM (FRONTEND) ##################


  This is a system that I designed and implemented for the faculty of my university 3 years ago.
  This was used to place students in various organizations based on criteria such as location of student, course of study ,etc.
  
  
  You can clone this project to explore it for learning purposes.
  It has been opened source now because due to changing requirement, a new one has been implemented to be used by the faculty, hence the faculty does not rely on this.
  
  
  This project has not been maintained in 3 years as a result of me leaving the organization hence a lot of things may change in their implementation for the angular framework.
  
  
  Feel free to send me an email for any question that you may have on oseikofi88@yahoo.com.
   
   
   Regards.
