#############INTERNSHIP PLACEMENT SYSTEM (FRONTEND) ##################


  This is a system that I designed and implemented for the faculty of my university in 2017 when I was a student.
  This was used to place students in various organizations based on criteria such as location of student, course of study ,number of slots required by company, company location, etc.

  Angular 4 was used with Google Maps API for geocoding, directions, places(autocomplete) and geolocation used.
  
  
  It has been opened source now because due to changing requirement, a new one has been implemented to be used by the faculty, hence the faculty does not rely on this.
  
  
  This project has not been maintained in 7 years  as a result of me leaving the organization hence a lot of things may change in their implementation for the angular framework.
